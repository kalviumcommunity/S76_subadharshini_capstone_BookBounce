### Key Features:
- Secure authentication with JWT and bcrypt
- Real-time updates via WebSockets (Socket.io)
- Advanced search & geo-location based discovery
- OTP-based Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
- Automated due date reminders and tracking
- Rating & review system for trusted exchanges
- PDF/Excel export of user lending history
- AI-based recommendation engine
- Web3 integration for digital book lending via smart contracts
